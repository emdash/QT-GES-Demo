Compiling:

Make sure you have qt >= 4.7, including qt-declarative.

You also need gstreamer, and gst-editing-services installed
somewhere.

You need qt-mobility installed. If it is not in the default prefix (/usr),
set the QTMOBILITY_ROOT environment variable before running make.

$ make

Running:

$ ./ges-demo

Installing:

don't.

Bugs:

You need to drag each clip slightly before its delete button will work.
