A GES Demo sporting a QT and QML

Compiling:

Make sure you have qt >= 4.7, including qt-declarative and qt-opengl,
and the development libraries.

You also need gstreamer, and gst-editing-services, and
all related development headers.

You need qt-mobility installed. If it is not in the default prefix (/usr),
set the QTMOBILITY_ROOT environment variable before running make.

For the moment, you also need the qtgst-qmlsink, and
qtgst-qmlsink-devel package.

$ make

Running:

$ ./ges-demo

Installing:

don't.

Bugs:

You need to drag each clip slightly before its delete button will work.
