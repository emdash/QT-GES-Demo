A GES Demo sporting a QT and QML

Compiling:

Make sure you have gstreamer, gst-convenience, and
gst-editing-services installed somewhere. Note: last I checked,
gst-editing services didn't install a .pc file, so I wrote my own.

$ make

Running:

$ ./ges-demo

Installing:

don't.

Bugs:

You need to drag each clip slightly before its delete button will work.
